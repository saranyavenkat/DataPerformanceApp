### `Easy Peasy`

We need any state management library to store the state to accomplish "Persisting measurements for future visits to the app". I chose Easy peasy, because it is extending redux and user friendly to manage the states. 

### `Material ui core and icons`

To do Add and delete operation on the test data, we need mutiple components and I am familiar with material UI, So I chose the same. The Editable tabele of Material-table is extended from material UI

### `moment`

It is for easy time conversions
